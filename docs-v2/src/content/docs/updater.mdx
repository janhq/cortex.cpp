This document outlines the architectural design for a C++ updater responsible for downloading and executing
the installers for the CLI and Server binaries.

## Overview

The updater is designed to check for available updates, download the necessary installer files, and execute
them to update the CLI and Server binaries.

## Components

### 1. **Version Management Module**

- **Purpose**: Responsible for checking the current version of the installed binaries and determining if updates are available.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Retrieve the current version from local installations.
  - Fetch information regarding the latest version from a remote source and save such info in `.cortexrc`.
  - Determine if an update is necessary based on version comparison.

### 2. **Installer Download Manager**

- **Purpose**: Handles downloading the installer files from specified URLs.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manage HTTP requests to fetch installer files.
  - Handle errors during download.
  - Save downloaded installers in a temporary directory.

### 3. **Installer Execution Module**

- **Purpose**: Executes the downloaded installer files to perform updates.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Launch the installer with appropriate command-line arguments.
  - Monitor the installation process and capture any output or errors.
  - Ensure that installation completes successfully before proceeding.

### 4. **User Interface (CLI)**

- **Purpose**: Provides a command-line interface for users to initiate updates and view status messages.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Display current version information for CLI and Server: `cortex -v`
  - Inform users about available updates and progress during downloading and installation.
  - Handle user input for initiating updates: `(sudo) cortex update`

## Workflow

1. **Initialization**:
   - The updater starts and initializes all necessary modules.

2. **Version Check**:
   - The Version Management Module retrieves the current versions of both CLI and Server from local installations.
   - It fetches the latest version information from a remote source.

3. **Update Decision**:
   - If newer versions are available, the updater proceeds to download the installers; otherwise, it informs the
   user that no updates are necessary.

4. **Download Process**:
   - The Installer Download Manager downloads the latest installer files using HTTP requests.
   - Progress is reported back to the User Interface.

5. **Installer Execution**:
   - Once downloaded, the Installer Execution Module runs the installer with silent mode.
   - It monitors the installation process, capturing any output or errors.

6. **Completion Notification**:
   - After successful installation, the User Interface notifies users of completion or any issues encountered
   during installation.
   - Logs are updated with relevant information about the update process.
