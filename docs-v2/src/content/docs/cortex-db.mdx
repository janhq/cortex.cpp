This document outlines Cortex database architecture which is designed to store and manage models, engines,
files and more.

## Tables Structure

### schema Table

The `schema` table is designed to hold schema version for cortex database. Below is the structure of the table:

| Column Name        | Data Type | Description                                             |
|--------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| version            | INTEGER   | A unique schema version for database.                   |

### models Table
The `models` table is designed to hold metadata about various AI models. Below is the structure of the table:

| Column Name        | Data Type | Description                                             |
|--------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| model_id           | TEXT      | A unique identifier for each model (Primary Key).      |
| author_repo_id     | TEXT      | The identifier for the repository where the model is stored. |
| branch_name        | TEXT      | The branch name in the repository that contains the model. |
| path_to_model_yaml | TEXT      | The file path to the YAML configuration file for the model. |
| model_alias        | TEXT      | The optional alias or friendly name for the model. |
| model_format       | TEXT      | The format or type of the model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, GGUF, etc.). |
| model_source       | TEXT      | The source or origin of the model (e.g., a URL or file path). |
| status             | TEXT      | Current status of the model (e.g., "downloaded", "downloadable").. |
| engine             | TEXT      | The name or identifier of the engine or framework used for running or deploying the model.. |
| metadata           | TEXT      | Additional metadata or information about the model, such as a JSON string containing various attributes or properties. |

### hardware Table
The `hardware` table is designed to hold metadata about hardware information. Below is the structure of the table:

| Column Name        | Data Type | Description                                             |
|--------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| uuid               | TEXT      | the primary key for the table, meaning that each row must have a unique value in this column.      |
| type               | TEXT      | The type of hardware. |
| hardware_id        | INTEGER   | An integer value representing the hardware ID. |
| software_id        | INTEGER   | An integer value representing the software ID associated with the hardware. |
| activated          | INTEGER   | A boolean value (0 or 1) indicating whether the hardware is activated or not. |
| priority           | INTEGER   | An integer value representing the priority associated with the hardware. |


### engines Table
The `engines` table is designed to hold metadata about the different engines available for useage with Cortex.
Below is the structure of the table:

| Column Name  | Data Type | Description                                             |
|--------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| id           | INTEGER   | A unique identifier for each engine (Primary Key).      |
| engine_name  | TEXT      | The name of the engine. |
| type         | TEXT      |  |
| api_key      | TEXT      |  |
| url          | TEXT      |  |
| version      | TEXT      | The current version of the engine. |
| variant      | TEXT      |  |
| status       | TEXT      | Current status of the engine (e.g., "downloaded", "downloadable"). |
| metadata     | TEXT      | Additional metadata or information about the engine. |
| date_ceated  | TEXT      | Date when the engine was downloaded. |
| date_updated | TEXT      | Date when the engine was last updated. |

### files Table
The `files` table is designed to hold metadata about objects dowloaded via Cortex.

| Column Name | Data Type | Description                     |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| id         | TEXT      | The primary key for the table    |
| object     | TEXT      | The type of hardware.            |
| purpose    | TEXT      | Purpose of file                  |
| filename   | TEXT      | The name of the file.            |
| created_at | INTEGER   | Date when file was created       |
| bytes      | INTEGER   |                                  |
