An embedding is a vector that represents a piece of text, with the distance between vectors indicating similarity, which means closer distances mean more similar texts, while farther distances mean less similar texts.

:::note
The Cortex Embeddings feature is fully compatible with OpenAI's [Embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings) endpoints.

## Usage
### CLI
```bash
# Without Flag
cortex embeddings "Hello World"
# With model_id Flag
cortex embeddings [options] [model_id] "Hello World"
```
### API
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="request" label="Request Example">
  To generate an embedding, send a text string and the embedding model name **(e.g., 'nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16')** to the Embeddings API endpoint.
  The Cortex-cpp server will return a list of floating-point numbers, which can be stored in a vector database for later use.
  ```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:39281/v1/embeddings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": "Your text string goes here",
    "model": "nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16",
    "stream": false
 }'


  ```

## Capabilities
### Batch Embeddings
Cortex's Embedding feature, powered by the [`llamacpp`](/docs/cortex-llamacpp) engine, offers an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. It supports processing multiple input data prompts simultaneously for batch embeddings.
### Pre-configured Models
We provide a selection of pre-configured models designed to integrate seamlessly with embedding features. These optimized models include:
- Mistral Instruct 7B Q4
- Llama 3 8B Q4
- Aya 23 8B Q4
