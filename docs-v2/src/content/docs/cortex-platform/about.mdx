# Cortex Platform

:::warning
ðŸš§ Cortex Platform is currently under development. Our documentation outlines the intended behavior of Cortex, which may not yet be fully implemented in the codebase.
:::

## OpenAI API Equivalence

Cortex's roadmap is to eventually support full [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) equivalence.

Our goal is to help developers to build applications with on-device AI and with a fully open-source stack. 

Cortex is currently compatible with the following OpenAI API endpoints:
- [/chat/completions](/api-reference#tag/inference/post/v1/chat/completions)
- [/embeddings](/api-reference#tag/embeddings/post/v1/embeddings)
