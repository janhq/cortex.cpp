   cd cortex.cpp
   git submodule update --init
   ```
2. Build the Cortex.cpp :

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="Mac Silicon" label="Mac Silicon">
    ```sh
    cd engine
    make configure-vcpkg
    make build CMAKE_EXTRA_FLAGS="-DCORTEX_CPP_VERSION=latest -DCMAKE_BUILD_TEST=OFF -DMAC_ARM64=ON -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Mac Intel" label="Mac Intel">
    ```sh
    cd engine
    make configure-vcpkg
    make build CMAKE_EXTRA_FLAGS="-DCORTEX_CPP_VERSION=latest -DCMAKE_BUILD_TEST=OFF -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
