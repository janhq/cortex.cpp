:::warning
ðŸš§ Cortex is currently under active development. Our documentation outlines the intended behavior
of Cortex, which may not yet be fully implemented in the codebase.
:::

Cortex is designed to be hardware aware, meaning it can detect your hardware configuration and
automatically set parameters to optimize compatibility and performance, and avoid hardware-related errors.

## Hardware Optimization

Cortex's hardware optimization allows it to do the following:

- **Context Length Optimization** maximizes the context length allowed by your hardware, ensuring that you
can work with larger pieces of text and more complex models without performance degradation.
- **Engine Optimization**: we detect your CPU and GPU, and maintain a list of settings optimized for each
engine-hardware combination, e.g. taking advantage of AVX-2 and AVX-512 instructions on CPUs.

## Hardware Awareness

- Preventing hardware-related error.
- Error Handling for Insufficient VRAM: When loading a second model, Cortex provides useful error messages if
there is insufficient vRAM memory. This proactive approach helps prevent out-of-memory errors and guides
users on how to resolve the issue.
- Model Compatibility Detection: Cortex automatically detects your hardware configuration to determine the
compatibility of different models. This ensures that the models you use are optimized for your specific hardware setup.
- This is for the Hub, and for existing models.

## Hardware Management

### Activating Specific GPUs

- Cortex gives you the ability to activate specific GPUs for inference, giving you fine-grained control over
hardware resources. This is especially useful for multi-GPU systems.

You also have the option to deactivate all GPUs, to run inference on only CPU and RAM.

### Hardware Monitoring

- Monitoring System Usage
- Monitor VRAM Usage: Cortex keeps track of vRAM usage to prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors. It ensures
that vRAM is used efficiently and provides warnings when resources are running low.
- Monitor System Resource Usage: Cortex continuously monitors the usage of system resources, including CPU,
RAM, and GPUs. This helps in maintaining optimal performance and identifying potential bottlenecks.
