## Key Improvements

The new version brings several major improvements:

- **2x Faster Inference**: We've completely rewritten our inference engine to deliver up to 2x faster generation speeds.
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Memory requirements are now 30% lower, allowing you to run larger models on the same hardware.
- **Enhanced Quantization**: New quantization options provide better quality-performance trade-offs.
- **Improved API Compatibility**: Full OpenAI API compatibility for seamless integration.

## Code Example

Getting started with Cortex 2.0 is easier than ever:

```python
import cortex

# Initialize the client
client = cortex.Client()

# Generate text
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama3",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's new in Cortex 2.0?"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Hardware Recommendations

With the new optimizations, here's what you can expect to run:

| Model | Minimum RAM | Recommended GPU |
| ----- | ----------- | --------------- |
| Llama3-8B | 8GB | RTX 3060 (8GB VRAM) |
| Llama3-70B | 32GB | RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM) |
| Gemma-7B | 8GB | RTX 3050 (6GB VRAM) |

## What's Next

This is just the beginning of our 2.0 series. Over the coming months, we'll be rolling out:

- Multimodal support for image input and generation
- Fine-tuning capabilities directly through our CLI
- Mac M-series specific optimizations
- Direct model editing for customization

Ready to upgrade? Update to Cortex 2.0 with a simple command:

```bash
pip install cortexcpp --upgrade
```

We can't wait to see what you build with Cortex 2.0!
