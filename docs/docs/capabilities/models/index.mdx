description: The Model section overview

Models in cortex are used for inference purposes (e.g., chat completion, embedding, etc.) after they
have been downloaded locally. Currently, we support different engines including `llama.cpp` with the
GGUF model format, and ONNX for edge or different model deployments.

In the future, you will also be able to run remote models (like OpenAI GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) via
Cortex. Support for OpenAI and Anthropic engines is under development and will be available soon.

When you run `cortex start` in the terminal, cortex automatically starts an API server. (This
functionality was inspired by the Docker CLI.) The cortex server manages various model endpoints which
can facilitate the following:
- **Model Operations**: Run and stop models.
- **Model Management**: Pull and manage your local models.

## Model Formats

Cortex supports three model formats and each model format require specific engine to run:
- GGUF - run with `llama-cpp` engine
- ONNX - run with `onnxruntime` engine

:::info
For details on each format, see the [Model Formats](/docs/capabilities/models/model-yaml#model-formats) page.

## Cortex Hub Models

To make it easy to run state-of-the-art open source models, we quantize popular models and upload these
versions the our own space in HuggingFace at [Cortex's HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/cortexso).
These models are ready to be downloaded and you can check them out at the link above or in our [Models section](/models).

### Model Variants

Built-in models are made available across the following variants:

- **By format**: `gguf` and `onnx`
- **By Size**: `7b`, `13b`, and more.
- **By quantization method**: `q4`, `q8`, and more.
