:::warning
🚧 Cortex.cpp is currently under development. Our documentation outlines the intended behavior of Cortex, which may not yet be fully implemented in the codebase.
:::

When Cortex.cpp is started, it automatically starts an API server, this is inspired by Docker CLI. This server manages various model endpoints. These endpoints facilitate the following:
- **Model Operations**: Run and stop models.
- **Model Management**: Manage your local models.
:::info
The model in the API server is automatically loaded/unloaded by using the [`/chat/completions`](/api-reference#tag/inference/post/v1/chat/completions) endpoint.
:::
## Model Formats
Cortex.cpp supports three model formats and each model format require specific engine to run:
- GGUF - run with `llama-cpp` engine
- ONNX - run with `onnxruntime` engine
- TensorRT-LLM - run with `tensorrt-llm` engine

:::info
For details on each format, see the [Model Formats](/docs/capabilities/models/model-yaml#model-formats) page.
:::

## Built-in Models 
Cortex.cpp offers a range of built-in models that include popular open-source options. These models, hosted on HuggingFace as [Cortex Model Repositories](/docs/hub/cortex-hub), are pre-compiled for different engines, enabling each model to have multiple branches in various formats.

### Built-in Model Variants
Built-in models are made available across the following variants: 

- **By format**: `gguf`, `onnx`, and `tensorrt-llm`
- **By Size**: `7b`, `13b`, and more.
- **By quantizations**: `q4`, `q8`, and more.

:::info
You can see our full list of Built-in Models [here](/models).

## Next steps
- Cortex requires a `model.yaml` file to run a model. Find out more [here](/docs/capabilities/models/model-yaml).
- Cortex supports multiple model hubs hosting built-in models. See details [here](/docs/model-sources).
