:::warning
🚧 Cortex.cpp is currently under development. Our documentation outlines the intended behavior of Cortex, which may not yet be fully implemented in the codebase.
:::

Models in cortex.cpp are used for inference purposes (e.g., chat completion, embedding, etc.). We support two types of models: local and remote.

Local models use a local inference engine to run completely offline on your hardware. Currently, we support llama.cpp with the GGUF model format, and we have plans to support TensorRT-LLM and ONNX engines in the future.

Remote models (like OpenAI GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) use remote engines. Support for OpenAI and Anthropic engines is under development and will be available in cortex.cpp soon.

When Cortex.cpp is started, it automatically starts an API server, this is inspired by Docker CLI. This server manages various model endpoints. These endpoints facilitate the following:
- **Model Operations**: Run and stop models.
- **Model Management**: Manage your local models.
:::info
The model in the API server is automatically loaded/unloaded by using the [`/chat/completions`](/api-reference#tag/inference/post/v1/chat/completions) endpoint.

## Model Formats
Cortex.cpp supports three model formats and each model format require specific engine to run:
- GGUF - run with `llama-cpp` engine
- ONNX - run with `onnxruntime` engine
- TensorRT-LLM - run with `tensorrt-llm` engine

:::info
For details on each format, see the [Model Formats](/docs/capabilities/models/model-yaml#model-formats) page.

## Built-in Models 
Cortex offers a range of [Built-in models](/models) that include popular open-source options. 

These models are hosted on [Cortex's HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/cortexso) and are pre-compiled for different engines, enabling each model to have multiple branches in various formats.

### Built-in Model Variants
Built-in models are made available across the following variants: 

- **By format**: `gguf`, `onnx`, and `tensorrt-llm`
- **By Size**: `7b`, `13b`, and more.
- **By quantizations**: `q4`, `q8`, and more.

## Next steps
- See Cortex's list of [Built-in Models](/models). 
- Cortex supports multiple model hubs hosting built-in models. See details [here](/docs/capabilities/models/sources).
- Cortex requires a `model.yaml` file to run a model. Find out more [here](/docs/capabilities/models/model-yaml).
