### Cortex.cpp offers four installer types

- **Network Installers** download a minimal script and require an internet connection to fetch packages during installation.
- **Local Installers** include all necessary packages, enabling offline installation without internet access.
- **Dockerfile** Installers are used to build a Docker image with Cortex ready to go.
- **Binary files** without package management.

### Cortex.cpp supports three channels

- **Stable**: The latest stable release on github.
- **Beta**: The release candidate for the next stable release, available on github release with the tag `vx.y.z-rc1`
- **Nightly**: The nightly build of the latest commit on dev branch, available on [discord](https://discord.com/channels/1107178041848909847/1283654073488379904).
