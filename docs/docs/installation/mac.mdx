:::warning
🚧 Cortex.cpp is currently under development. Our documentation outlines the intended behavior of Cortex, which may not yet be fully implemented in the codebase.
:::

## Cortex.cpp Installation
Cortex.cpp offers two installer types:
- Network Installers download a minimal system and require an internet connection to fetch packages during installation.
- Local Installers include all necessary packages, enabling offline installation without internet access.
:::info
Before installation, make sure that you have met the required [dependencies](#dependencies) and [hardware](#hardware) to run Cortex.
:::
1. Download the MacOs installer:
    - Stable: https://github.com/janhq/cortex.cpp/releases
    - Beta: https://github.com/janhq/cortex.cpp/releases
    - Nightly: https://github.com/janhq/cortex.cpp/releases
2. Ensure that Cortex.cpp is sucessfully installed:
```bash
# Stable
cortex

# Beta
cortex-beta

# Nightly
cortex-nightly
```

### Data Folder
By default, Cortex.cpp is installed in the following directory:
```
# Binary Location
/usr/local/bin/cortexcpp<env>

# Application Data (Engines, Models and Logs folders)
/Users/<username>/.cortexcpp<env>
```
## Uninstall Cortex.cpp
Run the uninstaller script:
```bash
# Stable version
sudo sh cortex-uninstall.sh

# Beta version
sudo sh cortex-beta-uninstall.sh

# Stable version
sudo sh cortex-nightly-uninstall.sh
```
:::info
The script requires sudo permission.

## Build from Source
1. Clone the Cortex.cpp repository [here](https://github.com/janhq/cortex.cpp).
2. Navigate to the `engine > vcpkg` folder.
3. Configure the vpkg:

```bash
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
vcpkg install
```
4. Build the Cortex.cpp inside the `build` folder:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path_to_vcpkg_folder/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
make -j4
```
5. Use Visual Studio with the C++ development kit to build the project using the files generated in the `build` folder.
6. Verify that Cortex.cpp is installed correctly by getting help information.

```sh
# Get the help information
cortex -h
```
