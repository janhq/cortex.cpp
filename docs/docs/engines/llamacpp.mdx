title: Llama.cpp
description: GGUF Model Format.
---

:::warning
🚧 Cortex.cpp is currently under development. Our documentation outlines the intended behavior of Cortex, which may not yet be fully implemented in the codebase.
:::

Cortex uses `llama.cpp` as the default engine by default the `GGUF` format is supported by Cortex.

:::info
Cortex automatically generates any `GGUF` model from the HuggingFace repo that does not have the `model.yaml` file.
